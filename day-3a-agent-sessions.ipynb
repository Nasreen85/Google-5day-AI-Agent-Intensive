We are likely to see an acceleration in the pace of new drug approvals and a greater ability to tackle previously intractable diseases in the coming years, thanks to these advancements.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned: **De Novo Drug Design and Optimization**. This is arguably one of the most revolutionary aspects of AI in drug discovery.\n\nLet me break it down further:\n\n**What \"De Novo\" Means in this Context:**\n\n\"De novo\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" In drug discovery, **de novo drug design** refers to the process of creating entirely new drug molecules from scratch, rather than modifying existing ones or relying solely on screening vast libraries of pre-existing compounds.\n\n**How AI Enables De Novo Design:**\n\nTraditional de novo design methods were often computationally intensive and relied on brute-force combinatorial approaches. AI, particularly **generative AI** and **deep learning**, has transformed this by allowing for more intelligent and efficient design:\n\n1.  **Generative Models (The \"Creators\"):**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These models involve two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates new molecular structures, and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real molecules and the generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic and drug-like molecules.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecular structures and can then sample from this space to generate novel molecules.\n    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers:** These can be trained on large datasets of known molecules (represented as sequences, like SMILES strings) to learn the \"grammar\" of molecular structures and generate new, valid ones.\n\n2.  **Optimization Algorithms (The \"Refiners\"):**\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** AI agents can be trained to \"explore\" the chemical space and learn strategies to generate molecules that satisfy specific desired properties. The AI receives \"rewards\" for generating molecules that score well on criteria like binding affinity, solubility, or predicted toxicity.\n    *   **Evolutionary Algorithms:** These algorithms mimic natural selection. They start with a population of candidate molecules, evaluate their \"fitness\" (based on desired properties), and then \"reproduce\" and \"mutate\" the fittest molecules to create the next generation, gradually improving the overall quality.\n\n**Key Goals of De Novo Design:**\n\nThe AI is trained to generate molecules that optimize for a combination of crucial properties, often simultaneously:\n\n*   **High Affinity/Potency:** The molecule must bind strongly to its intended biological target (e.g., a protein receptor or enzyme).\n*   **Selectivity:** It should bind preferentially to the target and not to other unintended targets, minimizing side effects.\n*   **Drug-likeness:** The molecule should have properties that make it suitable for administration to humans, such as good oral bioavailability, reasonable solubility, and stability.\n*   **Low Toxicity:** It should be non-toxic or have a very low level of toxicity.\n*   **Synthesizability:** The designed molecule should be practical and cost-effective to synthesize in a laboratory.\n*   **Novelty:** Often, the goal is to discover molecules with novel chemical structures that are distinct from existing drugs, potentially circumventing existing patents or overcoming resistance mechanisms.\n\n**Why is this a Breakthrough?**\n\n*   **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible molecules is astronomical (estimated to be around 10^60). AI can intelligently navigate this space far more efficiently than traditional methods, identifying promising candidates that might have been missed.\n*   **Speed:** Generative AI can design and propose novel molecular structures in days or weeks, a process that used to take months or years.\n*   **Overcoming Limitations of Existing Drugs:** AI can design molecules to overcome drug resistance or target proteins that were previously considered \"undruggable.\"\n*   **Personalized Medicine:** In the future, AI could potentially design bespoke molecules tailored to an individual patient's specific genetic makeup or disease profile.\n\n**Examples in Action (Reiterated and Expanded):**\n\n*   **Exscientia:** Their platform has generated several drug candidates that have entered human clinical trials. They use AI to optimize molecules based on multiple parameters, including those related to efficacy, safety, and manufacturability. They recently announced a novel drug candidate for **schizophrenia** that was designed by their AI in a significantly shorter timeframe than traditional methods.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** They achieved a significant milestone by bringing an AI-designed drug candidate for **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** from discovery to Phase 1 clinical trials in a remarkably short period. This demonstrated the power of their end-to-end AI platform, which includes de novo design capabilities.\n*   **Atomwise:** This company uses deep learning to predict how well small molecules will bind to target proteins, which is a crucial step in identifying potential drug candidates.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
